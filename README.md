# Generative Adversarial Networks

## Description
Hands-on experience in deep learning and GANs through two challenging projects. The first project focuses on Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGAN) with the MNIST dataset, while the second project tackles more complex image generation tasks such as Celebrity Face Generation or Super-Resolution GANs. Develops a solid understanding of GANs, experiment with various architectural and hyperparameter modifications, and gain proficiency in utilizing Weights and Biases for experiment tracking. The course will culminate in a final report summarizing findings, insights, and project outcomes.

## Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
 * Explore and experiment with the training of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate images similar to the MNIST dataset.

## Advanced GAN Experimentation for Complex Image Generation
 * Build upon knowledge gained from the DCGAN MNIST project and dive into more complex challenges. The task is to explore and experiment with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating images for a more complex dataset.
